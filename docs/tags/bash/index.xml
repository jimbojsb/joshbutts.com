      <description>Foreword I spent probably about half of my professional career as a hardcore Navicat user. Navicat was an actual good SQL GUI (MySQL specifically) that worked on Windows. When I later moved to MacOS, they had a version there too, though it never really felt as polished as the Windows version. Navicat still exists, but for whatever reason I transitioned to Sequel Pro (&amp;ldquo;Pancakes&amp;rdquo;). I used that for many years, but alas, it has become somewhat abandonware.</description>
